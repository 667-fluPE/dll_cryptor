A long time ago I made this cryptor to order.  but then I could not make a normal export implementation for the cryptable DLL.  In general, the export did not work.  I lost the customer.  Then, a year later, I remembered this project, opened it.  And he was surprised.  Why didn't I do it then?  It's so easy :)
