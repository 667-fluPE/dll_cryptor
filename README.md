A long time ago I made this cryptor to order.
But then I could not make a normal export implementation for the cryptable DLL.
In general, the export did not work. Because of this, the customer refused the order
Then, a year later, I remembered this project, opened it.  
And he was surprised.  Why didn't I do it then?  It's so easy :)

If you want to help me financially,
